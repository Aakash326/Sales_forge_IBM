## 🤖 Agent Evaluation Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Scoring System:

#### 1️⃣ **Research Agent (50% weight)**
- **Revenue Analysis**: $1M to $500B+ scale assessment
- **Market Position**: Leader/Challenger/Follower/Niche scoring  
- **Employee Scale**: Startup to Enterprise classification
- **Business Model**: Revenue structure analysis
- **Score Range**: 0-50 points

#### 2️⃣ **Scoring Agent (30% weight)**  
- **Growth Stage**: Startup/Growth/Mature/Declining assessment
- **Digital Maturity**: Low/Medium/High/Advanced transformation
- **Geographic Reach**: Local/Regional/National/Global presence
- **Score Range**: 0-40 points

#### 3️⃣ **Strategic Agent (20% weight)**
- **Competitive Advantages**: Unique value proposition analysis
- **Challenge Assessment**: Risk factor identification  
- **Technology Stack**: Innovation and modernization scoring
- **Score Range**: 0-10 points

### 🎯 Final Performance Score Calculation:
```python
final_score = (
    (research_score / 50) * 0.5 +      # 50% weight on research
    (scoring_score / 40) * 0.3 +       # 30% weight on scoring  
    (strategic_score / 10) * 0.2       # 20% weight on strategy
) * 100
```
