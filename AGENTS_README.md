## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running the Complete System

```python
from src.agents.sales_intelligence_orchestrator import SalesIntelligenceOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = SalesIntelligenceOrchestrator()

# Company and contact data
company_data = {
    "company_name": "TechFlow Inc",
    "company_size": 350,
    "industry": "software development",
    "annual_revenue": 25_000_000,
    "location": "San Francisco, CA"
}

contact_data = {
    "contact_name": "Sarah Chen", 
    "title": "CTO",
    "role": "technical_leader"
}

# Generate complete intelligence report
report = await orchestrator.generate_complete_intelligence_report(
    company_data=company_data,
    contact_data=contact_data,
    documents=documents  # Optional
)

# Format and display report
formatted_report = orchestrator.format_executive_report(report)
print(formatted_report)
```

### Testing the System

Run the integrated test suite:

```bash
python test_integrated_system.py
